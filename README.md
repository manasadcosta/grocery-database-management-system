This project is entitled Simple Online Groceries Ordering System. This is a web-based application that provides an online platform for the Grocery Store/Shop's customers or possible customers to order their desired product. The main purpose of this simple project is to let the customers buy their groceries without going to the shop or store. The system will list all products with available stocks and the customer can save their desired product to their shopping cart and checkout when they are done. The system is easy to use and has a simple user-interface
I developed this project using the following:
XAMPP v3.3.0 as my local  webserver that has a PHP Version 8.0.7
PHP Language
 SQLite  Database
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
jQuery
Ajax
Bootstrap
This web application contains 2 modules which are the Admin and Customer modules. The Admin Module is the system side where the Grocery's Management can manage all their products, stocks, and customers' orders. The Customer Module is the side where customers/visitors can browse, explore, add to cart, and place order their desired products. When the customer checkouts, the system will be adding a delivery fee on the total amount of customers to pay upon delivery. This system also generates a simple and printable sales report.
